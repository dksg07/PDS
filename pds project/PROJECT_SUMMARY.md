TOTAL ANNUAL BUDGET REQUIRED:        ‚Çπ505 Crores
```

### **Regional Insights**
```
WORST PERFORMING MATERIALS:
1. Steel in Coastal Areas: 15% faster deterioration (salt corrosion)
2. Asphalt in North India: 20% faster aging (temperature extremes)
3. Concrete in East India: 12% more weather damage (cyclones, flooding)

BEST MAINTENANCE STRATEGIES:
- Concrete roads: 5-year resurfacing cycle
